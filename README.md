# Neurodegenerative Disease Datasets
Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a wide range of conditions that result from progressive damage to cells and nervous system connections that are essential for mobility, coordination, strength, sensation, and cognition. Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Although no complete cure exists for most of these complex neurological diseases, it is possible to introduce treatment plans at the right time with accurate prognosis. The exploration of neurodegenerative disease datasets contributes to further their understanding and allow the advancement of the state-of-the-art of developing early diagnostic tools and providing access to more effective personalized therapies. This repository contains a collection of mostly publicly available datasets of neurodegenerative diseases that can be studied for these purposes.

## Dataset Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 1
**Publication** - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S153204641500221X

**Title** - Bringing Artificial Intelligence home for a better care of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis

**Summary** - Data from Portuguese ALS patients containing demographic and genetic features for each patient and results from multiple clinical exams and tests. Each data line represents a snapshot, i.e., a group of tests performed by the patient in a time interval, meaning a patient can have multiple records of snapshots.

**Size** - 8003 snapshots of the patient's condition over time

**Dimension** - 48 features (columns) for each snapshot (line)

**Format** - CSV

**Language** - English

**Year** (last update) - 2023

## Dataset Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 2
**Publication** - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28637276/

**Title** - Distinct brain transcriptome profiles in c9orf72-associated and sporadic ALS

**Summary** - Increasing evidence suggests that defective RNA processing contributes to the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The authors analyzed RNA sequencing data from C9orf72-positive and sporadic ALS cases, as well as healthy controls. These analyses confirmed that repetitive element expression was significantly increased in C9orf72-positive compared to C9orf72-negative or control cases. This leads to the conclusion that increased RNA polymerase II activity in ALS/FTLD may lead to increased repetitive element transcript expression, a novel pathological feature of ALS/FTLD.
