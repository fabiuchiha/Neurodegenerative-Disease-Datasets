# Neurodegenerative Disease Datasets
Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a wide range of conditions that result from progressive damage to cells and nervous system connections that are essential for mobility, coordination, strength, sensation, and cognition. Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Although no complete cure exists for most of these complex neurological diseases, it is possible to introduce treatment plans at the right time with accurate prognosis. The exploration of neurodegenerative disease datasets contributes to further their understanding and allow the advancement of the state-of-the-art of developing early diagnostic tools and providing access to more effective personalized therapies. This repository contains a collection of mostly publicly available datasets of neurodegenerative diseases that can be particularly useful to my PhD work where I will be applying network science techniques to study these diseases.

**Title** - Bringing Artificial Intelligence home for a better care of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis

**Summary** - Data from Portuguese ALS patients containing demographic and genetic features for each patient and results from multiple clinical exams and tests. Each data line represents a snapshot, i.e., a group of tests performed by the patient in a time interval, meaning a patient can have multiple records of snapshots.

**Size** - 8003 snapshots of the patient's condition over time

**Dimension** - 48 features (columns) for each snapshot (rows)

**Title** - Distinct brain transcriptome profiles in c9orf72-associated and sporadic ALS

**Summary** - Increasing evidence suggests that defective RNA processing contributes to the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The authors analyzed RNA sequencing data from C9orf72-positive and sporadic ALS cases, as well as healthy controls. These analyses confirmed that repetitive element expression was significantly increased in C9orf72-positive compared to C9orf72-negative or control cases. This leads to the conclusion that increased RNA polymerase II activity in ALS/FTLD may lead to increased repetitive element transcript expression, a novel pathological feature of ALS/FTLD.

## Dataset Alzheimer 1
**Source** - https://data.cdc.gov/Healthy-Aging/Alzheimer-s-Disease-and-Healthy-Aging-Data/hfr9-rurv/about_data

**Title** - Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging Data

**Summary** - This data is publicly available to all without restrictions by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States leading science-based, data-driven, service organization that protects the public’s health. The Alzheimer’s Disease and Healthy Aging Data Portal provides easy access to national and state level CDC data on a range of key indicators of health and well-being for older adults, including caregiving, subjective cognitive decline, screenings, vaccinations and mental health. These indicators provide a snapshot of currently available surveillance information, and can be useful for prioritization and evaluation of public health interventions.

**Title** - Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging Indicators: Cognitive Decline

**Summary** - This data is publicly available to all without restrictions by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States leading science-based, data-driven, service organization that protects the public’s health. The Alzheimer’s Disease and Healthy Aging Data Portal provides easy access to national and state level CDC data on a range of key indicators of health and well-being for older adults, including caregiving, subjective cognitive decline, screenings, vaccinations and mental health.

**Title** - Dysregulation of the epigenetic landscape of normal aging in Alzheimer’s disease

**Summary** - Aging is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The chromatin state, in particular through the mark H4K16ac, has been implicated in aging and thus may play a pivotal role in age-associated neurodegeneration. The authors compared the genome-wide enrichment of H4K16ac in the lateral temporal lobe of AD individuals against both younger and elderly cognitively normal controls. They find that while normal aging leads to H4K16ac enrichment, AD entails dramatic losses of H4K16ac in the proximity of genes linked to aging and AD. Their results establish the basis for an epigenetic link between aging and AD.

**Title** - Altered expression of histamine signaling genes in autism spectrum disorder

**Summary** - The histaminergic system (HS) is critical in cognition, sleep, and other behaviors. Although not well studied in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), HS is implicated in many neurological disorders, some of which share comorbidity with ASD. Preliminary studies suggest that antagonism of histamine receptors 1-3 reduces symptoms and specific behaviors in ASD patients and relevant animal models. The authors have used RNA sequencing, investigated the genome-wide expression, as well as a focused gene set analysis of key HS genes in postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex initially in 13 subjects with ASD and 39 matched controls.

**Title** - Exploiting Nonlinear Recurrence and Fractal Scaling Properties for Voice Disorder Detection

**Summary** - This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds one of 195 voice recording from these individuals.
