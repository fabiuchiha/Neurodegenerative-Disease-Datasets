# Neurodegenerative-Diseases-Datasets
Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a wide range of conditions that result from progressive damage to cells and nervous system connections that are essential for mobility, coordination, strength, sensation, and cognition. Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Although no complete cure exists for most of these complex neurological diseases, it is possible to introduce treatment plans at the right time with accurate prognosis. The exploration of neurodegenerative disease datasets contributes to further their understanding and allow the advancement of the state-of-the-art of developing early diagnostic tools and providing access to more effective personalized therapies. This repository contains a collection of mostly publicly available datasets of neurodegenerative diseases that can be studied for these purposes.

## Dataset Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 1
Publication - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S153204641500221X

Source - Private data, Brainteaser project - https://brainteaser.health/

Title - Bringing Artificial Intelligence home for a better care of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis

Summary - Data from Portuguese ALS patients containing demographic and genetic features for each patient and results from multiple clinical exams and tests. Each data line represents a snapshot, i.e., a group of tests performed by the patient in a time interval, meaning a patient can have multiple records of snapshots.

Size - 8003 snapshots of the patient's condition over time

Dimension - 48 features for each snapshot

Format - CSV

Language - English

Year (last update) - 2023

## Dataset Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 2
Publication - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28637276/

Source - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67196

Title - Distinct brain transcriptome profiles in c9orf72-associated and sporadic ALS

Summary - Increasing evidence suggests that defective RNA processing contributes to the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The authors analyzed RNA sequencing data from C9orf72-positive and sporadic ALS cases, as well as healthy controls.
